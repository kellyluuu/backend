    "bio": "Software Developer who enjoys problem-solving, find motivation in tasks that challenge my knowledge and experience, and I consider coding as a medium to express creativity. I find joy in improving or creating an efficient automated workflow to help people manage their duties, and free up time for other tasks or improve their quality of life. I've learned to become more adaptable and improvise on the fly during my time training for triathlons (including completing The Ironman). If anything, it has taught me that talent will take you far, but grit will take you further."
